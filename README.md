# 2ArmPid
This project was aimed to test and deploy PID control Law on a Two Arm PID Balance. The goal of this project was to level a wooden rod with the help of BLDC motors and propellors.
This was done to simulate the roll and pitch stability of a Quadcopter.
The angle wrt to the horizontal was found out using MPU 9250 by fusing both gyroscope and accelerometer values by using a complimentry filter.
